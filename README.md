#Grow With Me#

Libraries/Dependancies Used: 
React-Calendar
Semantic-Ui & Semantic-Ui-Css
Slick-Carousel & React-Slick 
Luxon


Please be sure to add these in!
Otherwise my application may not work D: 

There's a few more steps before I can say this project is complete and a few more refactoring to do.

I've spent a lot of my time learning how to use react-calendar for this application...I will need to do more to get it working the way I want it to.


ROADMAP FOR GROWWITHME: 

Update the ADD NEW ENTRY PAGE.
Enable validation, 
Construct the post methods. 
Pet Generator when creation of new Goal.

Construct the STATS PAGE. 
This component will be using CHARTJS.
And grabbing specific dates.

ProgressBar will need to fill in with props with the correct amount for each goal, rather than being static.

WHILE an onChange handler when pet reaches 50% and 100%. 

Construct the home page with more information.


Adding the feature where the creature grows depending on the percentage.
divided by 1/3, 
LVL 1 = 1%-49%
LVL 2 = 50%-99% 
LVL 3 MAX = 100%  

Research user authentication 
Sign-up form
Register the user to the Database with POST

ADD RESPONSIVE DESIGN IN THE FINAL PRODUCT!

There's a lot more work to be done, and a lot more code clean-up. 

See you on January 4th!
